## 2) Layer Progression Map  
```  
PK1 → PK2 → PK3 → (↻PK2 p1) → PK3 → PK4  
```  
*(PK1: Primitive Knowing, PK2: Image-Making, PK3: Image-Having, PK4: Property-Noticing)*

## 3) Recursive / folding-back moments (narrative)  
- **Page 1 folding-back (PK3 → PK2):** Student initially applied fraction simplification procedurally (PK3) but encountered confusion when comparing 6/8 and 3/4. Folded back to Image-Making (PK2) by sketching visual pie charts to reconstruct conceptual understanding of equivalence.  
- **Page 1 progression (PK2 → PK4):** After visual confirmation, student abstracted the pattern: "When we halve both parts, it stays equal" (PK4), demonstrating reconstruction toward Property-Noticing.

## 4) PK layer coding (evidence-rich)  

| Layer             | Evidence from transcript                          | Notes on classification                     |  
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |  
| Primitive Knowing | Recalled multiplication tables for denominators  | Activated prior arithmetic fluency          |  
| Image-Making      | Drew pie charts for 6/8 vs. 3/4                  | Concrete visualization to build mental model|  
| Image-Having      | Confidently stated "6/8 is three-quarters"       | Internalized fraction image                 |

## 5) Page-by-page PK-WAP coding  

| Page | Dominant layer(s)   | Representative evidence                     | Notes                                  |  
| ---: | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |  
| 1    | PK2, PK3, PK4       | "I split the pie into 8ths and shaded 6... same as 3/4!" | Image-making → Property-Noticing transition |  

---

## 6) Representative quotes  

**Student:**  
1. *"Is six-eighths equal to three-fourths? I’m not sure"* (p1, PK2: Seeking image formation)  
2. *"I drew two circles—one with 8 slices, one with 4. Six shaded is like three!"* (p1, PK2: Image-Making via visualization)  
3. *"Oh! So 6/8 reduces to 3/4 because both divide by two"* (p1, PK4: Property-Noticing)  
4. *"What if I divide numerator and denominator by three next?"* (p1, PK3: Testing Image-Having)  

**AI:**  
1. *"Let’s visualize this. Can you sketch a pie divided into eighths?"* (p1, Scaffolding PK2)  
2. *"How many slices would be shaded for three-fourths in an eighth-division pie?"* (p1, Bridging PK2→PK3)  
3. *"What operation made 6/8 become 3/4?"* (p1, Prompting PK4)  
4. *"Does this work for other fractions like 9/12?"* (p1, Extending PK4)  

---

## 7) Missed opportunities (elaborated)  
1. **PK2→PK3 transition:** AI missed probing why student initially doubted equivalence (p1); asking "What made 6/8 seem unequal?" could have surfaced misconceptions.  
2. **PK4 depth:** AI accepted "divide by same number" without challenging student to formalize as \(\frac{a \div c}{b \div c}\) (p1), missing Formalising potential.  
3. **Fold-back leverage:** When student self-corrected via sketches (p1), AI failed to highlight this agency—e.g., "How did drawing help you resolve confusion?"  

---

## 8) Summary of Findings  
Student demonstrated moderate agency by self-initiating visual models to resolve uncertainty, progressing from Image-Making (PK2) to Property-Noticing (PK4). Tone shifted from hesitant ("I’m not sure") to confident ("Oh! So..."). Key growth occurred through recursive fold-back to visual representation when procedural application faltered. No evidence of Observing or beyond; engagement centered on reconstructing equivalence concepts.  

---

## 9) Final observations  
The dialogue exemplifies PK’s recursive nature: confusion triggered productive fold-back to Image-Making, enabling reconstruction toward abstraction. Student agency peaked during self-driven visualization, though AI missed chances to metacognitively frame this strategy. Tone remained task-focused, with PK progression confined to inner layers. To deepen learning, AI should explicitly name fold-back moments (e.g., "You used drawings to rebuild your understanding—that’s a great strategy!").  

---

## 10) Conclusion  
P94-G6-S4 illustrates how fraction equivalence barriers can drive fold-back to visual foundations, enabling PK2→PK4 growth. Conservative coding confirms outer layers (Observing+) were unreached—typical for tutoring dialogues. Pedagogically, this case underscores the need for AI to spotlight reconstruction *strategies* (e.g., sketching) during fold-backs to foster metacognition. Trajectory: PK1 → PK2 (↻) → PK3 → PK4.
