## 3) Recursive / folding-back moments (narrative)  
On Page 3, the student encountered a fractional coefficient during substitution (e.g., "y = (2x-1)/3"). This triggered folding-back from Image-Having (routine substitution) to Image-Making as they grappled with fraction manipulation: "Wait, how do I plug this into the other equation?" (P3). The student reconstructed understanding by revisiting equivalent fraction operations, supported by AI prompts to decompose the expression. This led to Property-Noticing when recognizing consistent fraction relationships: "Oh, multiplying both equations by 3 clears all denominators!" (P4).

## 4) PK layer coding (evidence-rich)

| Layer             | Evidence from transcript | Notes on classification |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Primitive Knowing | "I know x + y = 10 means their sum is 10" (P1) | Basic arithmetic facts |
| Image-Making      | "I’ll draw arrows from this equation to substitute into the other one" (P2) | Creating mental representations |
| Image-Having      | "I automatically substitute y from Eq1 into Eq2" (P3) | Internalized substitution process |
| Property-Noticing | "When both equations have fractions, multiplying by LCD works" (P4) | Pattern recognition |
| Formalising       | No explicit formal definitions | No abstraction beyond procedures |
| Observing         | No evidence | No metacognitive analysis |
| Structuring       | No evidence | No theoretical connections |
| Inventising       | No evidence | No novel extensions |

## 5) Page-by-page PK-WAP coding

| Page | Dominant layer(s) | Representative evidence | Notes |
| ---: | ----------------- | ----------------------- | ----- |
|    1 | Primitive Knowing | "I remember elimination needs same coefficients" | Activating prior knowledge |
|    2 | Image-Making      | "I’m visualizing these lines crossing at the solution" | Constructing mental models |
|    3 | Image-Having → Fold-back → Image-Making | "I can substitute... wait, how to handle y = (2x-1)/3?" | Procedural failure triggers reconstruction |
|    4 | Property-Noticing | "Fraction denominators always match the LCD pattern" | Generalized observation |

## 6) Representative quotes

**Student:**  
1. P1: "If 2x + y = 7, I can solve for y as 7-2x" (Primitive Knowing)  
2. P2: "I’m mapping how variables connect between equations" (Image-Making)  
3. P3: "Substituting feels automatic now" (Image-Having)  
4. P3: "Why did I get fractions? Let me retry step-by-step" (Fold-back)  
5. P4: "These denominators are always multiples!" (Property-Noticing)  
6. P4: "Elimination avoids fractions when coefficients match" (Property-Noticing)  

**AI:**  
1. P1: "What fundamental operations relate these equations?" (Primitive Knowing activation)  
2. P2: "Describe how you see these equations interacting" (Image-Making scaffold)  
3. P3: "When fractions appear, what operation preserves equality?" (Fold-back support)  
4. P3: "Compare denominators in both equations" (Property-Noticing prompt)  
5. P4: "What systematic approach handles fractions?" (Procedural formalization)  
6. P4: "How might elimination simplify this?" (Strategy comparison)

## 7) Missed opportunities (elaborated)  
1. **P2:** AI missed probing *why* substitution works geometrically (connecting equations to intersection points) to deepen Image-Making.  
2. **P3:** During fraction struggle, AI failed to ask: "What do equivalent forms reveal about variable relationships?" limiting Property-Noticing.  
3. **P4:** No challenge to abstract fraction-handling into a general rule (e.g., "How would this work for any denominators?"), missing Formalising.

## 8) Summary of Findings  
The student showed strong agency (72.9% talk) progressing from Primitive Knowing to Property-Noticing. Key growth occurred during P3 folding-back when fractional coefficients disrupted Image-Having, prompting reconstruction of fraction operations. Tone shifted from tentative (P1) to confident (P4) as they recognized systematic patterns. The AI effectively supported procedural layers but missed opportunities to formalize fraction strategies. Peak attainment was robust Property-Noticing of denominator relationships without reaching abstraction.

---

## 9) Final observations  
PK movement occurred primarily within inner layers, with folding-back serving as the critical growth mechanism. Student agency manifested through self-initiated error correction ("Let me retry" – P3), though AI dominated strategic direction. Tone remained engaged but procedural; deeper conceptual curiosity (e.g., "Why do these methods work?") went unexplored. To advance learning, AI should scaffold connections between algebraic patterns and their mathematical underpinnings.

---

## 10) Conclusion  
This case exemplifies effective inner-layer progression (Primitive Knowing → Property-Noticing) in equation solving, with folding-back enabling conceptual reconstruction. The student’s high verbal engagement signals readiness for Formalising prompts, which were notably absent. Pedagogically, it highlights the need for AI to leverage fraction struggles as opportunities for abstraction. The PK trajectory [PK→IM→IH→(FB)→PN] demonstrates how procedural disruptions can catalyze pattern recognition when adequately scaffolded.
