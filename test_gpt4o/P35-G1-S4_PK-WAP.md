### Introduction / Context

This analysis pertains to transcript P35-G1-S4, which involves a student engaging with an AI tutor to explore the concept of Taylor series and their application in approximating complex functions. The dialogue begins with a personality test to tailor the AI's teaching style, followed by a guided activity focusing on real-world applications of Taylor polynomials. The student is tasked with describing a scenario where approximation is crucial, refining the problem, and constructing a Taylor polynomial to approximate a given function. The analysis will conservatively code the student's progression through the Pirie-Kieren layers, noting recursive moments and potential learning opportunities.

## 3) Recursive / folding-back moments (narrative)

A significant folding-back moment occurs on Page 03 when the student initially suggests a scenario involving bacteria growth. The AI prompts the student to refine their understanding by considering why exact calculations are challenging, leading the student to revisit and deepen their grasp of the problem's complexity. This transition from Image-Making to Property-Noticing is crucial as the student reconstructs their understanding of why Taylor approximations are necessary.

Another folding-back occurs on Page 07, where the student evaluates the limitations of their Taylor polynomial approximation. Initially, the student constructs the polynomial, but upon testing its accuracy at \( t = 2 \), they recognize the polynomial's failure, prompting a return to understanding the polynomial's local versus global behavior. This reflection reinforces their comprehension of the approximation's limitations, moving from Formalising back to Property-Noticing.
